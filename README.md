# SDET Mastery Journey

**Code practice and projects for SDET transition journey**

Welcome to my transformation journey from QA Engineer to Software Development Engineer in Test (SDET). This repository showcases my coding practice, automation projects, and continuous learning in test automation and development.

## 🎯 Mission

Advancing from automation tester to SDET mastery by exploring diverse automation types, mastering advanced tools, and deepening expertise in test automation frameworks and software development practices.

## 📚 Learning Path

### Current Focus: Python Fundamentals
- **Programming Basics**: Variables, data types, control structures
- **Object-Oriented Programming**: Classes, inheritance, polymorphism
- **Data Structures & Algorithms**: Lists, dictionaries, sets, algorithms
- **Testing Frameworks**: pytest, unittest, test automation patterns

### Upcoming Topics
- API Testing with Python (requests, REST APIs)
- Web Automation (Selenium WebDriver)
- CI/CD Integration
- Database Testing
- Performance Testing
